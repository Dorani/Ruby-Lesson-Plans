# Security for user information is very important
# Passwords are virtually never stores in their string forms
# Hashed digests are stored in dbs
# In popular hashing algorithm in MD5 - bcrypt
# Creates a hash digest of the string as password




#obtained from the docs, require tech
require 'bcrypt'
