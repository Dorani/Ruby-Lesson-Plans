#We work with "things" ie objects created from a class
#Each instance will inherit so called features, ie:
  #properties(js) or attributes(ruby) which are all specified in the class


#Student is a class
  # attributes: fist name, last name, username, password

#Course is a class
  # attributes: course_id, short name, name, description
