#will return the type of data structure
#you can invoke methods on primitive types which is cool!

#to see all the methods available for our datatype:
first_name.methods

#after seeing all the methods on a data type
#you can use one, and chain another method on top of it!

age.to_s.class
#this will switch the type of to a string and get the class on it
