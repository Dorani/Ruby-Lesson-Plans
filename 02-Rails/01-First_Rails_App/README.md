##1st thing we need to do to start our rails app is:
    - rails new "name of the app"
      - this does the following:
          - creates a bunch of folders and files
          - runs bundle install:
            - bundler is a gem that grabs all the gems out of the box that comes with a default rails app and installs them => creates a sandbox and later on we can add gems as needed.
      - now we should have a full app with a ton of folders
